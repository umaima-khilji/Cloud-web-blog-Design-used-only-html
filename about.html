                        <h4>Let's start with the name. Where did 'cloud' come from?</h4>
                        <p>When the internet was in its infancy the word 'cloud' was used as a metaphor to describe how
                            the complex telephone networks connected. So, what exactly is it?</p>
                        <p>Cloud is a model of computing where servers, networks, storage, development tools, and even
                            applications (apps) are enabled through the internet. Instead of organizations having to
                            make major investments to buy equipment, train staff, and provide ongoing maintenance, some
                            or all of these needs are handled by a cloud service provider.</p>
                        <p>There are five key characteristics of a cloud computing environment:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Internet Access</li>
                            <li>Measured Service</li>
                            <li>On-Demand Self-Service</li>
                            <li>Shared Resource Pooling</li>
                            <li>Rapid Elasticity</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h1> Why is cloud computing important? </h1>
                        <p>Before cloud computing, companies had to store all their data and software on their own hard
                            drives and servers. The bigger the company, the more storage they needed. This way of
                            treating data is not scalable at speed. For example, if word started spreading about your
                            business and you suddenly had a lot of online orders, your servers would probably crash.
                            Good business meant hard work for the IT department.</p>
                        <p>It's not just businesses that benefit from cloud computing. The cloud has transformed our
                            lives as individuals as well. Many of us use cloud services every day. When we update our
                            status on social media, binge a new streaming series, or check our bank accounts we're most
                            likely using applications that are hosted by cloud services. These apps are accessed through
                            an internet connection rather than installed on our hard drives or devices.
